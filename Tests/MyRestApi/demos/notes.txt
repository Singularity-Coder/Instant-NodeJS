NODE JS AND MONGO DB


THEORY
Ctrl + ~ to open terminal in VS Code
RESTful principles - HTTP Verbs - GET, PUT, PATCH, POST, UPDATE
MVC Pattern - No view
Express Framework for building the API
DB - Mongo DB
Mongoose - schema based solution to model the data


NODE JS
https://nodejs.org/en/download/ 
- JavaScript on server side
- It is JS runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JS engine 
- It is Async and event driven - All APIs are non-blocking IO - so we can use callbacks or promises or async await 
- It is single threaded but can run multiple instances of the same app on multiple thread
- NPM is node package manager for node.js modules, comes preinstalled with NodeJS - www.npmjs.com


CHECK VERSION
node —version 


VS CODE EXTENSIONS
REST Client


CREATE PROJECT
cd Desktop/
mkdir MyRestApi
cd MyRestApi
npm init     (This will initialise MyRestApi directory)
code .        (This will open VS Code - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29955500/code-is-not-working-in-on-the-command-line-for-visual-studio-code-on-os-x-ma)
touch app.js
node app.js           (This will run the app if the file is saved)
console.log(“I am running…”);        // This is for printing stuff


PACKAGE.JS
This is like Gradle. It manages ur packages


INSTALL NODEMON NPM PACKAGE
// If u run app with this it will run anytime a change is made
sudo npm install -g nodemon        

// To run the app with nodemon
nodemon app.js

// To stop the app 
Ctrl + c


DIFFERENT START MECHANISMS
package.json

// replace "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1" with "start": "nodemon app.js" 
{
  "name": "myrestapi",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "My first Node Js App",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon app.js"
  },
  "author": "Hithesh",
  "license": "ISC"
}

// Run this command from now on
npm start


EXPRESS JS
Web framework for Node JS. Makes ur life easy setting up routes instead of using built-in HTTP module in Node JS


MONGOOSE.JS
https://mongoosejs.com/
